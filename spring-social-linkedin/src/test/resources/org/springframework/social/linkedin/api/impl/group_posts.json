Create content that people will be reading 10 years from now, and you\u2019ll be getting linkbacks for a decade.\n2. Audit Your Online Profiles: Is the biography up to date? More importantly, is your website\u2019s URL listed somewhere? The incoming links from these profiles may not weigh too much in Google\u2019s mysterious algorithm, but you\u2019ll be surprised what it can do if you have more than a handful of accounts online.\n3. Think Like Your Customer Types: Keep in mind that 25% of keywords have never been typed in before, but you\u2019ll want to aim for popular keywords with low competition if you can. Then write content around these keywords and learn to optimize.\n4. Hire an Expert: Yes, you can hire SEO company. Look for individuals or companies with proven track records, and monitor their bi-weekly reports closely ( https://www.topseos.com/rankings-of-best-pay-for-performance-seo-companies ).\nLearn more: https://bit.ly/tGu7cx\n5. Guest Post:Start guest posting on tons of relevant blogs. Blogs love fresh content, and for you it\u2019s a great way to build links, which will boost your rankings on Google.\n6. Content is King and Links are Queen: Google loves links, especially those from other relevant, authority websites. Join any and all industry associations, guest blog with a link back to your website, and submit your site to any relevant directories to grow your backlink profile and your searches.\n7. Bust Out the Camera: Video is such a huge thing now for business owners. Not only does it give your company personality, but it can also be spread across networks while linking back to your site. Create great videos filled with information people can share and then repeat. Now videos can be distributed across multiple platforms from one single platform, causing Google to love you.\n8. Colleges and Universities: The biggest SEO secret is that when .edu sites link to your website it gives you a higher Google ranking. Contact college and universities and find a reason for them to link to your site by running a special internship opportunity, for example.\n9. Update Your Site Frequently: The more often you update your site, the more important Google thinks it is. With every blog post, you have another chance at ranking for new search terms, so each article increases the odds of your site being found.\n10. Use the Right Keywords: Two effective ways of increasing your SEO rank are tagging articles and keyword analysis. You want to make sure your headlines are descriptive. You should also choose keywords that people are going to look for \u2014 so imagine yourself as a searcher.\n11. Move Away From Flash: Many small businesses, especially restaurants and bars, use Flash for their sites because it\u2019s easy to launch, looks good and is fairly cheap. While the sites might look decent, they rank really poorly in Google (without doing some tricks). Change your Flash-based site to WordPress or another platform, and you\u2019ll rocket up the search engine rankings.\n12. Have You Taken Advantage of Local Search?: Are you a local business? Have you claimed your listing on Google, Yahoo! and Bing? If not, stop reading this article now and go claim your business listings immediately! The future of search is personalized local results, and these valuable profiles are often overlooked.\n13. Know Exactly What Words People Use to Search: The biggest mistake people make in trying to rank high in Google is having no clue what people are actually typing into search engines to find you. An easy way to find this out is to go to the Google homepage and slowly start typing in your phrases. You\u2019ll notice Google suggested searches come up. Use those exact phrases in your titles. That\u2019s what people want, so give it to them.",
